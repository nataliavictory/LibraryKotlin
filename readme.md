### Description

### How to use the API

The API has the following endpoints:

- `POST /v1/api/books`:  creates a new book in the library.
- `PUT /v1/api/books/{id}`:  creates a new book in the library.
- `DELETE /v1/api/books/{id}`:  deletes a book from the library.
- `GET /v1/api/books/{id}`: searches for a book in the library by ID.
- `GET /v1/api/books`:  lists all books in the library.

The POST and PUT endpoints receive a JSON payload with the book information. The GET /v1/api/books endpoint returns a list of books in JSON format.

Below is an example of JSON payload to create or update a book:
